TODO
====

* Review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAJaNqdnrvg&feature=plcp

* Remove the non-set version of similarity: not worth the extra time, too much
  hammering on a simple point (manual testing sucks).

* Fix output portion of manual-test-runner slide.

* Consider removing or moving parametrize slide? Breaks the flow.

* Show code example for dependency injection?

* Use mock for FakeResponse as well as urlopen?

* Discuss potential fragility of mocking github response data in integration
  tests; talk about VCR equivalents.

* Add example of feature-adding workflow.

* Mention that tests can help later developers understand the codebase?

* Better styling for inline literals, especially within headers.

* Look into supporting highlighted-lines in docutils code-block, and use it to
  highlight important code in slides.

* Use impress.js movement/zoom to emphasize structure of talk.
